# pretext-quickstart
A quick and dirty way to get started with a PreTeXt project.

## Instructions

Make a copy of this folder.  Then in a terminal, run `./setup.sh` and follow the prompts.

You will be asked whether you already have PreTeXt downloaded, and if so, where the "mathbook" folder is located (default is parallel to the folder containing the current project).

You will be asked to provide information about the project.  The script will insert this information in the appropraite place.  

Finally, you will be given the option to generate html and latex/pdf files.
